## Examples

This folder contains examples for the Automated Measurement Framework. 

### Recommended starting points:
These are examples that have great documentation and "Getting started" guides.
- **Instrument drivers:** Can be used to test the functionality of the drivers included in the Framework.
- **RX:** Can be used to measure BER and PER sensitivity, waterfall diagrams, RSSI sweeps and blocking. Includes a "Getting started" list.
- **TX_CW:** Can be used to measure TX CW power (on the fundamental as well as harmonic frequencies). Includes a "Getting started" list.

### Recommended for more advanced users:
These are more specific examples that have less documentation and thus are not that suitable for new users.
- **Telec245:** Implements a whole T254 certification. (for the fg25...?)
- **DcDc_Spurs:** Measures DC-DC spur levels in TX CW mode.
